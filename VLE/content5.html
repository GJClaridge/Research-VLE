        <h2>Testing.</h2>
        <p>There are many reasons why we test. The most common reason is to find bugs that we may not know are there. Just because manual testing has not highlighted any bugs, that does not mean there are not any bugs. The absence of the evidence does not constitute evidence of the absence of bugs.</p>
        <p>When writing code, you are always testing. Everytime you run and compile the code you are writing, you are completed a manual test of your code. However, on larger projects, it is not enough just to run informal tests on your code so therefore need to run deep and comprehensive tests.</p>

        <h2>Different types of testing.</h2>
        <p>There are many differents types of testing that can be completed at different points throughout code development:</p>
        <p>Unit Testing - This is breaking down code into units or modules and testing that each one works as intended. By testing each module individually, all the fuctionality can be tested, ensuring successes and failures where appropriate (e.g for validation purposes) This can be black box or white box testing. Black box testing means you are not concerned with the workings of the code, just that inputs generate the expected outputs. White box focuses upon the workings of the code, and tests the internal variables and states. This is because there could be errors occuring that still provide the correct output, which is still a bug that you would want to solve!</p>
        <p>Intergration testing - One step up from unit testing, this tests how all the units or modules work when combined. Units are treated as black boxes for this process, because their workings should have been analysed in unit testing. Intergration testing makes sure that all people developing code are working to the same specification, such as interfaces and parameters. By continually intergrating, this can be continually completed.</p>
        <p>System testing - This is the testing of the entire systemm to ensure it meets specifications set out. Black box testing as the importance is that the system works. Therefore, having this carried out by people other than the developers is important, as they may use the system in ways the developers did not intend. This may highlight errors the developers may miss due to their familiarity with the system.</p>
        <p>Acceptance Testing - This is not likely to occur on your own code, but on large scale projects with stakeholders or investors, where people have been contracted in to develop the system for someone else. This tests the expectations of the systems and if it meet specifications. It may highlight that what the client originally asked for was not what they truely wanted. </p>

        <h2>Lots of Testing</h2>
        <p>In general, testing should occur as frequently as code is written. Never commit without testing otherwise you may commit broken code. Unit testing using a spreadsheet is very useful as it records the tests you have completed so any problems can be recreated if needed.</p>
        <p>However, all this testing is very time consuming and time may be better spent coding. There is a solution to this: Automated testing.</p>
        <p>Automated testing is written code that tests the code for you. Its quick and easy once written as it will test it everytime the code is run, as inform you of any problems.There are libraries available for Python and C++, as well as many other languages, which complete standard tests for you. However this is more complicated stuff that you will cover in more detail within University,</p>
