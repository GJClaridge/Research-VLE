        <h2>What is the purpose of the study?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to collect data for my final year project/dissertation. This study focuses on the learning of programming by first years using different tools and environments, such as Moodle, Codecademy and Codio. There is a heavy emphasis upon self-guided learning (learning outside of timetabled sessions). The aim of the project is to see if certain environments can improve and enhance students learning of programming.  </p>

        <h2>What do I have to do? </h2>
        <p>In this study you will need to participate over 2-3 weeks. The schedule is as follows:
Small programming test and questionnaire (30mins) which will be used to measure your programming capabilities.
Following this you will be assigned an environment (e.g Codecademy) which you will be required to use for a few weeks (2-3weeks).
A further programming test (30mins) which will be used to measure the benefit of the environment on your programming capabilities.
Survey/Feedback from you on your experience (10mins).</p>

        <h2>What are the benefits of taking part? </h2>
        <p>I cannot promise that the study will help you personally but the information collected from the study will help increase the understanding on learning tools and environments and how they improve the learning of programming. This research could be used to make modifications to how current and future students learn to code across all levels of programming related degrees.</p>
