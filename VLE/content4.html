        <h2>Efficiency.</h2>
        <p>When developing programs and software, it is important to consider the efficiency of the item developed. There are multiple contexts to efficiency of programs, such as time and space (or memory). There can be a tradeoff between time and memory, where compromising one can improve the other, athough careful consideration needs to be given to ensure there is any benefit between the two. This is a form of optimization. It is important to optimize code, but not to be concerned with optimizing it before it is written, as this can make it hard to code, especially if you are new to coding or not a very stong coder.</p>

        <h2>O notation.</h2>
        <p>O notation is used to descibe the complexity of algorithms or code, in terms or time and/or space. Common examples of O notation are O(n), O(log n) and O(n^2). The 'n' refers to the size of the problem, such as values to be searched or sorted. It is commonly used to describe the worst case scenario of a situation, although can sometime be used to show average or best case. Below is a chart that depicts most of the O notation that commonly occurs.</p>

        <h2>O Notation terms.</h2>
        <p>O(1) - This means the n doesnt really matter, the action is always going to take the same time and space. A good example of this is getting the first item from an array, as this will never take a different time or take up different space. Printing a string or number is also very similiar.</p>
        <p>O(n^2) - Many of the simple sorting algorithms, such as Bubblesort and Selection sort, are O(n^2). A common occurance in code of such notation would be nested loops, each time the code will loop, it will take more time. Furthermore, O(n^3) and greater are all possible similar notations. This algorithm of this notation takes what is known as polynomial time to complete.</p>
        <p>O(log n) - This is where it becomes slightly more complicated. If you know how a binary search works, then you will understand this complexity. As seen in the graph, as you get into larger 'n', the rate of increase beings to slow down, with it being one of the best complexities for an algorithm to have.</p>
        <p>Going beyond these terms, things become slow. When reaching O(n!), its almost not worth worrying about the algorthim in the first place! This is exponentioally bad, and is an exponential in nature.</p>
